# Instance Discovery 

## Identify Instances without Lacework Agent

A script to review current Lacework instance inventories against active agents to help identify hosts lacking the Lacework agent.

Supports GCP & AWS. Azure to follow shortly.

## How to Run

`docker run -v ~/.lacework.toml:/home/user/.lacework.toml droessmjlacework/instance-discovery --json`

``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 instances_without_agents.py --json
```

## Results

There are three separate result sets:
- Instances without Agents -- These are resources which we have in Resource Inventory which could not be reconciled with agents reporting in. 
- Agents without Inventory -- These are agents which are reporting in, but for which we do not have an inventory record of the instance. This could be due to inventory staleness or from agents running on uncovered Cloud Accounts or on-prem VMs.
- Instances with Agents -- These are the inventory records which correctly reconcile with agent info. 

Note: As we don't currently inventory Fargate tasks, these will always show as "Agents without Inventory"
